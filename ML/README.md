# README
In this time, I used Object2Vec algorithm and AWS SageMaker.
Because I cannot give you AWS access, I downloaded the jupyterNotebook which I wrote on AWS SageMaker.

```bash
|- main.ipynb # File for creating and training the model.
|- train_c.jsonl #File for temporary data storage generated by main.ipynb
|- train_r.jsonl　#File for temporary data storage generated by main.ipynb
|- validation_c.jsonl　#File for temporary data storage generated by main.ipynb
|- validation_r.jsonl　#File for temporary data storage generated by main.ipynb
```
